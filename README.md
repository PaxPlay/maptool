# maptool

OpenGl utility for loading and inspecting a Overwatch map. Can only load very basic geometry.

Last 'working' version was for map exports from OWLib for Overwatch (not Overwatch 2). I don't believe this has any use for anyone except for me unless you want to copy code for setting up an OpenGL context and rendering a basic 3D scene.
